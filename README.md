# todolist
This project is a simple web-based to-do list application developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to help users create and manage their to-do tasks effectively.
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page, including input fields, buttons, and lists.
CSS: Applied for styling the application, providing an attractive and visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: Implemented to add dynamic functionality to the to-do list. It enables users to add, complete, and delete tasks without requiring a page refresh.
Key Features:
Task Entry: Users can enter new tasks in the provided input field. The input field is equipped with a placeholder for guidance.
Task Addition: By clicking the "Add" button, tasks are added to the list. Each task is displayed as a list item.
Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the associated checkboxes. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strike-through style, and their appearance changes to a muted color.
Task Deletion: If a user wants to remove a task, they can click the "Delete" button next to the task. This functionality allows users to declutter their to-do list.
